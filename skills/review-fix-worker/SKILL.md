description: Fix open findings from a reviews/ todo-list file one by one with TDD, checking each off in the file. Starts from a fresh context using only the self-contained review file. Handles skip decisions for minor findings and user decisions for security findings. Use manually after task-review.

# Review Fix Worker

Read one review file under `reviews/`, fix every `open` finding one by one, and mark each finding's
status in the file immediately after it is resolved. The review file is the complete contract: it
carries the repository root, branch, base, task path, change class, and validation tier, so this
skill works from a fresh context with no other input.

Invocation authorizes modifications to the branch named in the review file for non-security
remediation. Never expand scope beyond the frozen finding set. Never delete, stage, or commit review
files; they are ignored workflow state retained across review passes. `finish-task` removes all
review files associated with the completed task after its PR is CI-green.

## Efficient evidence handling

Keep the main context for decisions, behavioral TDD evidence, and targeted source inspection.
Delegate broad, read-only interpretation to isolated subagents when available and require concise
structured results. Do not delegate primary RED-GREEN decisions, concurrent edits, or stateful
checks that share a database, port, simulator, fixture, generated output, or external service.

Use the smallest evidence that proves a result. Broad commands and full test output belong in the
task log directory; return the exit status, duration, concise result, relevant failure excerpt, and
log path. Use stable names such as `unit.log` or `typecheck.log` and overwrite a superseded passing
log instead of accumulating timestamped copies. Enforce the 5 MiB cap while each command runs.
Never write secrets, credentials, environment contents, source files, or database exports to these
logs. Preserve current failure evidence until the failure is resolved.

## Workflow

### 1. Locate and load the review file

Accept an optional review-file path. Without one, inspect `reviews/` at the repository root:

- exactly one file with `open` findings → use it;
- several → prefer the file whose `**Branch:**` matches the current branch; otherwise ask the user
  which to work on;
- none → report that the review loop is clean and suggest `/skill:finish-task`.

Read the whole file. Verify `**Repo:**` matches the current repository root. If the current branch
differs from `**Branch:**`, check out the named branch when it exists locally; otherwise stop and
report the mismatch.

### 2. Establish the task log directory

Recompute the deterministic task log directory and refuse mismatched or symbolic-link paths:

```sh
LOG_ROOT=/tmp/agent-workflows
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"
REPO_KEY="$(printf '%s' "$REPO_ROOT" | git hash-object --stdin | cut -c1-12)"
BRANCH_KEY="$(printf '%s' "$BRANCH" | git hash-object --stdin | cut -c1-12)"
REPO_LOG_DIR="$LOG_ROOT/$REPO_KEY"
TASK_LOG_DIR="$REPO_LOG_DIR/$BRANCH_KEY"
for path in "$LOG_ROOT" "$REPO_LOG_DIR" "$TASK_LOG_DIR"; do
  if [ -L "$path" ]; then
    printf 'Refusing symbolic-link log path: %s\n' "$path" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done
if [ -e "$TASK_LOG_DIR" ]; then
  [ -d "$TASK_LOG_DIR" ] && [ -f "$TASK_LOG_DIR/repo-root" ] && [ -f "$TASK_LOG_DIR/branch-name" ] &&
    [ "$(cat "$TASK_LOG_DIR/repo-root")" = "$REPO_ROOT" ] &&
    [ "$(cat "$TASK_LOG_DIR/branch-name")" = "$BRANCH" ] || {
      printf 'Refusing mismatched task log directory: %s\n' "$TASK_LOG_DIR" >&2
      exit 1
    }
else
  mkdir -p "$TASK_LOG_DIR"
  printf '%s\n' "$REPO_ROOT" > "$TASK_LOG_DIR/repo-root"
  printf '%s\n' "$BRANCH" > "$TASK_LOG_DIR/branch-name"
fi
```

### 3. Triage before fixing

List every `open` finding with id, axis, severity, and claim. Then, before touching code:

- **Minor and nit findings:** present them as one list and ask the user which to fix and which to
  skip. For each skip, ask for a one-line reason, set the finding's status to `skipped-minor` with
  the reason, and append one line per skip to the task file named in the review header:
  `- skipped (minor): TR-4 — <claim> — <reason>`. Without a task file, record skips only in the
  review file.
- **Security findings:** before changing security-sensitive code, handle every security finding
  with the user. Explain in plain English:
  - the realistic scenario;
  - the likely consequence;
  - the exposure or probability;
  - what the fix would change.

  Wait for an explicit decision on each finding:
  - **Fix**: keep the finding in the work list.
  - **Accept**: set the finding's status to `accepted-security-risk`, and record the user's reason
    in the task file when one exists. Without a task file, keep the reason in the review file and
    return it to the caller for the PR risk section.

  Every security finding needs a user decision before this skill ends. An accepted finding remains
  visible in the final result.

### 4. Fix findings one by one

Work through the remaining `open` findings in severity order (blocker, major, then approved
minor/nit). For each finding:

1. Inspect the cited location and the evidence that originally supported the finding.
2. Load `tdd` only for defects in production or test code with an observable behavioral seam:
   reproduce the finding as a failing test (RED), fix it (GREEN), refactor. Never invoke `tdd` for
   plan-only, documentation-only, dependency-only, or declarative configuration-only remediation;
   verify those with targeted syntax, consistency, or configuration checks instead.
3. Run focused tests and checks for the affected files. Do not run the full canonical suite after
   each finding.
4. Mark the finding `**Status:** fixed` in the ignored review file immediately, with one short line
   of proof (test name or check), then commit that finding's tracked fix on the review file's branch.
   Never stage the review file. One commit per finding keeps fixes individually revertable, while
   the local review file preserves crash- and context-reset recovery state.

If a new concern appears during remediation:

- Fix a failing test or direct regression caused by the remediation inside the same batch.
- Record an unrelated or minor concern as `deferred-out-of-scope` in the review file.
- Stop and ask the user when the concern is a new blocker, a new major issue, or requires a change
  to architecture, scope, or a trust boundary.

### 5. Verify the frozen findings

After all fixable findings are resolved:

1. For each finding identifier, confirm the original failing scenario is covered by a focused test,
   static check, or direct diff evidence.
2. Run the focused test batch once after all remediation is assembled.
3. Run one check at the review file's validation tier: document/plan consistency for
   `documentation`, affected dependency or configuration proof for `focused`, and focused tests for
   `canonical` (the one final canonical validation is owned by `finish-task`).
4. Store verbose output in `TASK_LOG_DIR`.

Do not search untouched parts of the diff for new minor findings. If targeted verification fails,
continue correcting the same frozen findings and rerun only the failed focused proof. If a fix
materially changed architecture, scope, or a trust boundary, finish this pass and recommend a fresh
`task-review` invocation; do not start it without user approval.

### 6. Report

All tracked remediation is already committed per finding. Commit any remaining tracked task-file
records for skip, accept, or defer decisions; never stage ignored review-file status updates. Confirm
no tracked task work remains uncommitted, then return a concise structured result:

- review file path, branch, and head SHA before and after remediation;
- each finding id with final status: `fixed`, `accepted-security-risk`, `skipped-minor`,
  `deferred-out-of-scope`, or `unresolved`;
- focused proof and validation commands, status, and log paths;
- accepted security risks and user reasons;
- whether a fresh `task-review` is recommended.

Tell the user the exact next command: `/skill:task-review` to re-review, or `/skill:finish-task`
when nothing remains open. Do not report success while any finding that the user did not explicitly
skip or accept remains open.
