name: teach
description: Teach the user a new skill or concept in a persistent teaching workspace. Use whenever the user says "teach me", asks to be taught something, or asks to learn or study a topic.
argument-hint: "What you want to learn, with any links or files for context"
---

The user has asked you to teach them something. This is a stateful request. They intend to learn the topic over many sessions, so treat the workspace as something that persists and grows.

## Teaching workspace

Treat the current directory as a teaching workspace. The state of the user's learning lives in these files:

- `MISSION.md`: Why the user wants to learn this topic. It grounds every teaching decision. Use the format in [MISSION-FORMAT.md](./MISSION-FORMAT.md).
- `./reference/*.html`: Reference materials. These are the compressed learnings from lessons: cheat sheets, algorithms, syntax, yoga poses, glossaries. Make them beautiful documents that print well and are built for quick lookup.
- `RESOURCES.md`: The trusted sources you teach from. Use the format in [RESOURCES-FORMAT.md](./RESOURCES-FORMAT.md).
- `./learning-records/*.md`: Records of what the user has learned. They work like architectural decision records: they capture non-obvious insights that steer future sessions and help you judge what to teach next. Title them `0001-<dash-case-name>.md` and increment the number each time. Use the format in [LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md](./LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md).
- `./lessons/*.html`: The lessons. A lesson is a single self-contained HTML file that teaches one tightly scoped thing tied to the mission. This is the primary unit of teaching.
- `NOTES.md`: A scratchpad for user preferences and working notes.

## Philosophy

Deep learning needs three things:

- **Knowledge**, captured from high-quality, high-trust resources.
- **Skills**, built through relevant lessons you design from that knowledge.
- **Wisdom**, which comes from interacting with other learners and practitioners.

Until `RESOURCES.md` is well populated, focus on finding high-quality resources. Never trust your parametric knowledge.

Some topics lean more on knowledge, others more on skills. Theoretical physics is mostly knowledge. Yoga is mostly skill.

## Voice

Write every word the user reads in the `write-well` voice, which is about sounding like one person talking to another instead of like a machine. Invoke the `write-well` skill and run its self-review checklist before you ship anything, since teaching copy is where the machine tells creep in most. The rules in short: no em dashes, lead with the claim instead of warming up to it, cut filler like "Here's the thing" and "it's worth noting", drop tricolons and "not X but Y" reframes, and sound like a capable adult explaining something to another capable adult. When the user gives brand or tone context, match it. When that clashes with the rules, the rules win.

## Intake

The argument to this skill is the user's own explanation of what they want to learn, often followed by context: links, file paths, pasted notes, anything they already have. Treat that context as primary source material. Read every file and fetch every link before you decide what to teach.

Your first job in a new workspace is alignment, not teaching. How much you interview depends on what they gave you:

- If they passed little or no context, interview them properly. Find out what they want, why, what they already know, and what "done" looks like. Lean on the `talk-it-through` skill.
- If they passed rich context, do not re-ask what it already answers. Infer the mission from it and confirm with them: here is what I think you are after and why, is that right? Correct course from their answer.

Either way, stop once you are aligned. A few sharp questions beat a long form.

Then write the mission into `MISSION.md` using [MISSION-FORMAT.md](./MISSION-FORMAT.md), and record any prior knowledge they disclose as learning records. Every lesson traces back to this mission. Without it, lessons drift into the abstract and you lose the thread of what to teach next.

On later sessions in an existing workspace, skip the interview. Read `MISSION.md` and the learning records instead, and revisit the mission only if the user's goal has shifted.

## Zone of proximal development

Each lesson should challenge the learner just enough. Not so easy it bores them, not so hard it loses them.

When the user has not named an exact thing to learn, pick the next step by:

- Reading their learning records to see where they are.
- Choosing the most relevant thing for their mission that sits just past what they already know.

## Lessons

A lesson is the main thing you produce, the unit in which knowledge and skills reach the user. Each lesson is one self-contained HTML file in `./lessons/`, titled `0001-<dash-case-name>.html`, with the number incrementing each time.

Make a lesson beautiful, with clean typography and a readable layout, because the user comes back to these to review.

Teach ONE thing. A lesson should be quick to finish but give the user a real win they can build on. Tie it directly to the mission and keep it in the user's zone of proximal development.

Produce exactly one lesson at a time, then stop and hand control back to the user. Never generate several lessons in a batch. The user reads the lesson, practices, and tells you what to teach next (often by flagging passages). Each new lesson is a response to where they actually are, not a plan you run ahead of them.

The lesson is the only channel for teaching. Once the workspace is aligned and you are teaching, answer every question the user asks with a lesson, never with an inline reply in the terminal. A question about the material is a request for the next lesson, so build it as one. Treat everything in the session as part of teaching until the user clears the session; if they want a plain chat instead, that is their call to make by clearing, not yours to assume. (Intake and alignment at the very start are the exception, since there is nothing to teach yet.)

Make opening a lesson as easy as possible, ideally a single CLI command that opens the HTML file in the browser.

## Flagging and follow-up lessons

A lesson is not a dead end. Every lesson must give the user a way to tell you what didn't land, and it has to work from inside the browser with no server running.

Embed [LESSON-FLAGGING.html](./LESSON-FLAGGING.html) verbatim into every lesson, and set the lesson id on the body tag (`<body data-lesson-id="0001-some-name">`). Do not rebuild the mechanism per lesson. The snippet lets the reader:

- Select any passage and flag it as **Unclear** or **Explain more**, with an optional note.
- Keep flags in `localStorage` under a per-lesson key, so they survive a refresh and never bleed across lessons.
- Hit **Copy my questions** to put a paste-ready block on the clipboard (lesson id, each quoted passage, note, and tag), which then clears that lesson's flags. A flag is spent once it reaches the teacher.

Close every lesson by explaining this in plain terms: highlight what's fuzzy, hit Copy my questions, paste it back to your teacher. Name the button and the step. No vague "ask me anything".

When the user pastes flags back, generate exactly one next lesson (the next number in `./lessons/`) built around those flags, then stop and wait. Depending on what they flagged, that is either a fresh follow-up that goes deeper on the sticking points, or a re-taught version of the same material that fixes what was unclear. Never edit the original lesson in place, and never queue up more than the single next lesson. Each pass is a new, self-contained lesson.

## Knowledge and resources

Gather knowledge from trusted sources first, and track them in `RESOURCES.md`. Build each lesson around only the knowledge needed for the skill it teaches.

Litter lessons with citations, the links to external sources behind each claim. This makes a lesson trustworthy and gives the user a path to go deeper.

## Skills

Skills come from practice with a tight feedback loop, not from reading. In this workspace that loop is the flag-and-follow-up cycle in [Flagging and follow-up lessons](#flagging-and-follow-up-lessons): the user reads, flags what's unclear or wants more on, and you answer with the next lesson. Some topics also call for walking the user through real-world steps, like yoga poses, where the feedback comes from doing the thing and reporting back.

Do not use quizzes. They test recall instead of building skill, and they pull a lesson away from teaching one thing well.

## Wisdom

Wisdom comes from real-world practice, from testing skills outside the learning environment.

When the user asks something that needs wisdom, try to answer, but ultimately point them to a community: a place, online or offline, where they can test their skills for real. A well-moderated forum, a subreddit, a local class, an interest group.

Look for high-reputation communities they can join. If they say they don't want to join one, respect it and note it in `RESOURCES.md`.

## Reference documents

As you build lessons, build reference documents too. Lessons can point to them, and they track raw units of knowledge that stay useful across lessons.

Users rarely revisit lessons. They do revisit references. A reference is the compressed essence of a lesson, built for quick lookup.

Some topics lend themselves to reference:

- Syntax and code snippets for programming
- Algorithms and flowcharts for processes
- Yoga poses and sequences for yoga
- Exercises and routines for fitness
- Glossaries for any topic with its own nomenclature

Glossaries matter most. Once you create one, follow it in every lesson.

## NOTES.md

The user will sometimes tell you how they want to be taught, or things to keep in mind. Record those preferences here so you can lean on them when designing lessons.
