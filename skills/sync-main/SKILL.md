Checkout to main branch and pull the latest changes from remote.

Run the following git commands:
1. `git checkout main` - switch to the main branch
2. `git pull` - pull the latest changes from remote

If there are uncommitted changes that would be overwritten, warn the user and ask if they want to stash changes first.
